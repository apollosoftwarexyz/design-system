### Patterns are general combinations of elements that are re-used frequently in user interfaces such as dialogs, forms, headers and navigation.

Patterns fall in-between elements and templates. Whilst they are not independently a complete functional solution or 'page' that can simply be inserted into a project, they allow you to avoid re-inventing the wheel with common combinations of elements.

For example; in your application you will likely have many flows that require a dialog of some kind - even on the same page - however each dialog would be different depending on the flow itself. So a 'create project' dialog would be considered a 'template' as it is an application of the generic 'dialog' pattern.

If you believe a pattern is common in other UI libraries and missing, or you find yourself rebuilding the same set of components for various projects, please [open an issue ticket](https://github.com/apollosoftwarexyz/design-system/issues/new) to introduce the pattern into the design system.

### Elements are the basic building blocks (components) of user interfaces such as buttons, links, and inputs. They may be reused to introduce consistency in look and functionality between products.

If you believe a component is common in other UI libraries and missing, or you find yourself rebuilding the same component for various projects, please [open an issue ticket](https://github.com/apollosoftwarexyz/design-system/issues/new) to introduce the component into the design system.

## Overview

```
<components show="elements" />
```

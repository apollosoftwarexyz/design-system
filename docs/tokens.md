### Design tokens are the atoms of the system. They are a set of common brand values for colors, fonts and more.

Where possible (and appropriate) these should be used instead of hard coded values to ensure a better consistency across any platform. If you believe the system is missing common values, please [open an issue ticket](https://github.com/apollosoftwarexyz/design-system/issues/new) on GitHub with details of the token to be added.

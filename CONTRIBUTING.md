# Contributing to Design System

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Apollo Design System. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How to Contribute

1.  When contributing, please first discuss the change(s) you wish to make via [an issue](https://github.com/apollosoftwarexyz/design-system/issues/new) with Apollo Design System team.
2.  In most cases, we should be extending existing components instead of creating new ones.
3.  If you wonder whether you should create an Element or a Pattern, ask yourself: _“can this be broken down into smaller pieces?”_ If the answer is yes, there’s a high chance that it should be a Pattern instead of an Element. If you believe you need to make a Pattern however you are missing multiple Elements, simply open issues for the Elements you need or create them and include them in your PR.
4.  Components in the system are labelled with status labels that reflect their state of completion. Make sure to update the status on any component you work on.
5.  Finally, when you’re done, submit your pull request and ask someone from Apollo Design System team to review it.
